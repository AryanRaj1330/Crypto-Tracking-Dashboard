        <div id="about">Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Operating on a peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin enables users to send and receive transactions without relying on intermediaries like banks. These transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, ensuring transparency and security through cryptographic verification. Bitcoin's finite supply, capped at 21 million coins, ensures its scarcity, contributing to its value as a store of wealth and a hedge against inflation. Often referred to as "digital gold," Bitcoin has found utility in various roles, from investment and remittances to purchases of goods and services. It has gained prominence due to its potential to provide financial independence, especially in regions with unstable banking systems or hyperinflation. However, Bitcoin also faces challenges, including high energy consumption from mining, regulatory scrutiny, and price volatility. Despite these hurdles, it remains a symbol of innovation in finance, appealing to investors and tech enthusiasts worldwide for its disruptive potential and promise of financial decentralization.</div>
