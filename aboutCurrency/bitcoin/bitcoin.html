        <div id="about">Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing users to send and receive transactions without relying on intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain, a public ledger that ensures transparency and security. Each transaction is verified by network nodes through cryptography and added to the blockchain, making it tamper-proof. Bitcoin is often considered the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, setting the stage for an entire industry. 

            Its finite supply—capped at 21 million coins—ensures scarcity, contributing to its perceived value. Bitcoin can be used for various purposes, from purchasing goods and services to serving as an investment or store of value akin to digital gold. It has gained traction due to its potential to offer financial independence, particularly in regions with unstable banking systems or hyperinflation. However, Bitcoin is not without challenges. It faces criticism for high energy consumption due to mining, price volatility, and regulatory scrutiny in various countries. Despite this, Bitcoin remains a symbol of innovation in finance, appealing to both tech enthusiasts and institutional investors seeking an alternative to traditional financial systems.</div>
