        <div id="about">NEO is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency often referred to as "Ethereum of China," launched in 2014 by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. Originally called Antshares, it rebranded to NEO in 2017 and focuses on enabling a smart economy by integrating digital assets, digital identity, and smart contracts. NEO uses a delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) consensus mechanism, which provides high transaction speeds and energy efficiency compared to proof-of-work systems. 

            The platform supports a wide range of programming languages, making it developer-friendly and accessible for creating decentralized applications (dApps). NEO has a dual-token system: NEO, which represents ownership and generates GAS tokens used to pay for network operations like transaction fees and smart contract execution. With its emphasis on regulatory compliance and partnerships, particularly in China, NEO positions itself as a blockchain ecosystem aimed at bridging the gap between traditional economies and decentralized technologies.</div>
