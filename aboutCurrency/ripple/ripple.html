        <div id="about">Ripple (XRP) is a digital cryptocurrency and payment protocol launched in 2012 by Ripple Labs to enable fast, low-cost, and scalable cross-border transactions. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP is not mined; instead, all tokens were pre-mined and are gradually released by Ripple Labs. Operating on a consensus ledger rather than a proof-of-work system, Ripple offers faster and more energy-efficient transactions. Its primary purpose is to facilitate real-time gross settlements and remittance payments, providing liquidity for banks and financial institutions without the need for pre-funded accounts. By bridging different fiat currencies, Ripple addresses inefficiencies in the global payment infrastructure and promotes financial inclusion. Despite facing legal challenges, including an ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple continues to gain recognition as a reliable solution for modernizing cross-border financial transactions.</div>
