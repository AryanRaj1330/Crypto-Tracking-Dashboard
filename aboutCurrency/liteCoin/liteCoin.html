        <div id="about">Litecoin (LTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google engineer, as a lighter and faster alternative to Bitcoin. Built on Bitcoin's codebase, Litecoin shares many similarities with its predecessor but introduces key differences, such as a faster block generation time of 2.5 minutes and a different hashing algorithm called Scrypt. This makes Litecoin more efficient for smaller transactions while allowing for more accessible mining compared to Bitcoin's SHA-256 algorithm. 

            Litecoin is designed to offer low-cost, secure, and borderless payments, making it suitable for everyday transactions and as a complementary digital currency to Bitcoin. It has gained significant adoption over the years, often referred to as the "silver to Bitcoin's gold." With a capped supply of 84 million coins, four times that of Bitcoin, Litecoin maintains scarcity while offering improved transaction speeds. It remains a reliable choice for users and merchants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</div>
