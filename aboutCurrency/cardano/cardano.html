        <div id="about">Cardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency launched in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum's co-founders. It stands out for its research-driven, peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development, aiming to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Cardano uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, which is designed to be more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than proof-of-work systems. The platform is structured in multiple layers, separating the cryptocurrency (ADA) ledger from the smart contract layer, which enhances flexibility and security. Cardano focuses on solving key challenges in scalability, interoperability, and sustainability within blockchain systems. Its emphasis on formal verification and rigorous testing makes it particularly appealing for enterprise-level applications and governments. As one of the leading third-generation blockchains, Cardano is continuously evolving with features aimed at improving global financial inclusivity and creating a more decentralized economy.</div>
