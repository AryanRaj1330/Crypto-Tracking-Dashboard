        <div id="about">Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a cryptocurrency and open-source blockchain platform designed to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, a co-founder of Ripple, and the Stellar Development Foundation, Stellar aims to connect financial institutions, payment systems, and individuals to promote global financial inclusion. The platform uses a unique consensus mechanism known as the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which ensures secure and efficient transaction validation without the need for energy-intensive mining. 

            Lumens (XLM), the native currency of the Stellar network, act as a bridge currency for facilitating trades between different fiat currencies and assets. Stellar is particularly popular for remittances and micropayments due to its speed and affordability. Its design focuses on reducing barriers to financial access, especially in underbanked regions. Stellar continues to collaborate with institutions and organizations worldwide, cementing its role as a key player in modernizing global payment systems.</div>
